// if one matches, one sees an alert that the round was tied, won or lost. Besides, the result variable gets updated.

// Without the following code, the user would only see the alerts from the playGame function. 
// So each round he gets an alert, if he lost, won or tied that specific round.
// The following code gives an overall result.
// Therefore it takes the variable result, which was updated in every iteration of the while loop.
// it's important that this code is outside of the while loop, so it gets executed after all 5 rounds were played.
// if the result variable turns out to be 0, the payer and computer tied overall (eg WON, WON, TIE, LOSS, LOSS)
// if the result variable turns out to be > 0, the player won overall (eg WON, WON, LOSS, LOSS, WON) ->
//                      ***the result variable changed like this*** start at 0 -> Won (+1), Won (+1) = 2, Loss (-1) = 1. Loss (-1) = 0, WON (+1) = 1
